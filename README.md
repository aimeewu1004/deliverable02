How the Python script works:
- The python script uses the csv module to open and extract data from the csv files 
- The Python script has functions and code that save the data extracted from the csv files into variables 
- There is a template HTML schema with {variable_name} placeholders included in the Python script that will be populated with the data from the csv file once the Python script has been run
- The script creates an HTML file populated with data of the athlete from the csv file 

How to run it:
1. Update the csv_file variable with the path to the desired csv file 
    - Ex: csv_file = "athletes/womens_team/Adrienne Stewart21142907.csv"
2. Name the output file with the Athleteâ€™s name
    - Ex: output_file = "athlete_dashboard_Adrienne_Stewart.html"
3. Run the Python script via VS Code or Terminal
